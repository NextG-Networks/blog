      <h2>Mapping the Causal Factors</h2>
      <p>
        Every decision exists within a web of cause and effect. Learning to map these causal factors 
        helps us understand the true impact of our choices and make more informed decisions.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Understanding Causality</h3>
      <p>
        Before making a decision, consider:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What factors led to this moment?</li>
        <li>What are the direct consequences of each option?</li>
        <li>What are the indirect or secondary effects?</li>
        <li>How do these factors interact with each other?</li>
      </ul>
