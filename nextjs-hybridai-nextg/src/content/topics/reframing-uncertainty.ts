      <h2>Reframing Uncertainty as Agency</h2>
      <p>
        Uncertainty is often seen as a problem to solve or a fear to overcome. But what if we could 
        reframe uncertainty as a source of agency and possibility?
      </p>
      
      <h3>The Power of Reframing</h3>
      <p>
        When we shift our perspective on uncertainty:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We see opportunities where we once saw threats</li>
        <li>We recognize our power to shape outcomes</li>
        <li>We become more comfortable with not knowing</li>
        <li>We open ourselves to unexpected possibilities</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Practical Strategies</h3>
      <p>
        This lesson provides concrete techniques for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recognizing when uncertainty is actually freedom</li>
        <li>Using uncertainty as a creative force</li>
        <li>Making decisions in the face of the unknown</li>
        <li>Embracing the journey rather than fixating on the destination</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Exercise</h3>
      <p>
        Think of a current situation where you feel uncertain. How might you reframe this 
        uncertainty as an opportunity for agency and growth?
