      <h2>Understanding the Landscape of Choice</h2>
      <p>
        Every decision we make exists within a complex landscape of possibilities, constraints, and consequences. 
        Understanding this landscape is the first step toward making choices that align with who we are and where we want to go.

        <li>The nature of choice in an uncertain world</li>
        <li>Recognizing the options available to us</li>
        <li>Understanding the constraints we face</li>
        <li>Mapping the potential outcomes</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>
